As a machine learning lifelong student, I am interested in natural language processing (NLP) applications. I am equipped with advanced statistical modeling knowledge such as Bayesian modeling and inference, generalized linear models (GLM), mixed effects models and longitudinal data analysis.  
To complement my toolbox of modeling, I am learning different neural networks architectures used in NLP as well as Keras and Tensorflow to leverage my knowledge in this area. For more information, please check out my resume [here](/assets/Hamed_Helali_Resume.pdf)

I also love reading (fiction), hiking in nature and drinking tea with a friend.
