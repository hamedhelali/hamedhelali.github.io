As a statistics lifelong student, I am interested in machine learning algorithms and numerical algorithms to solve the models as well. I am equipped with advanced statistical modeling knowledge such as Bayesian modeling and inference, generalized linear models (GLM), mixed effects models and longitudinal data analysis.  
To complement my toolbox of modeling, I am learning deep neural networks (DNN) as well as Tensorflow to leverage my knowledge in this area.
